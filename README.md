# Modern Web Intro

A set of examples and instructions to guide you though the crazy modern web-stack
from HTML 101 to TypeScript and React (in development).

## Getting Started

The first thing you will want to do is install the dependencies you will need:

Required
  - Git: https://git-scm.com/downloads
  - Node/NPM (LTS): https://nodejs.org/en/
  - VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/
  - Chrome or FireFox (your choice)

Optional (but very nice to have)
  - React Developer Tools: (Chrome)[https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en] (FireFox)[https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/react-devtools/]
  - VSCode Plugins (installed via the sidebar in-app)
    - ESLint
    - TSLint
    - JavaScript Standard Style
    - SpellChecker
    - npm

Once you have installed the dependencies, you should be able to open a terminal and run the following commands:
```
git --version
node --version
npm --version
```

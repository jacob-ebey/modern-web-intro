    <h1>Some External JavaScript :D</h1>

    <p>
      Just like CSS, JavaScript can clutter up your HTML files and it is good practice to put
      functionality into separate <em>.js</em> files.
    </p>

    <p>
      All the <em>script</em> script tags are loaded and executed as they are loaded. That
      allows us to include our external files and reference the functions we define in them.
    </p>

    <p>
      If you have fast enough eyes, you may notice the bold headers below flash up near the top
      of the screen before the JavaScript can fully load and execute to generate the list of items.
    </p>
